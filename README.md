# maskSLIC
Simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) in a region of interest


This code demonstrates the adaption of SLIC for a defined region of interest. 
The main contribution is in the placement of seed points within the ROI. 

The code is a modification of the SLIC implementation provided by Scikit-image (http://scikit-image.org/)
